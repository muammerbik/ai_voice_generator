# ai_voice_generator

I would like to share with you the "AI Voice Generator" application that I developed with Flutter. This application offers the ability to transform and personalize the voices of famous characters. At the beginning of the application, you are greeted with an animation followed by the "Onboarding" page. Then, the "Premium" page becomes visible. Depending on whether the user wants to make a purchase or not, the user has the chance to generate a certain number of voices for free. Afterwards, we are directed to the "Generate" page. On this page, you can write any text you desire, choose the character you want, and create a voice. From the "Settings" page, you can see how many attempts you have and the option to purchase premium if you wish. You can also share or download the created voice file on the "Audio Player" page.
